# SpMV_optimization_in_GPUs_using_CNNs

The accompanying code for my Diploma thesis at cslab (http://artemis.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/17088).

This repo is an archive for the scripts and methods used in the thesis, and is not easily configurable without prior knowledge. 

For questions and/or the complete image dataset for the training you can contact me directly.
